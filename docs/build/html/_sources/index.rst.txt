CIFY documentation
=====================

.. note::
   This project is still under development.

CIFY is a framework for common computational intelligence
paradigms written in Python. The goal of the framework is to
provide end users with the ability to easily and reliably
implement artificial intelligence meta-heuristics. We also
provide a collection of well-known meta-heuristics.

For more details, check out :doc:`what-is-cify`.
If you want to learn more about what's under the hood, read through the
:doc:`necessary-knowledge` page.

Installation
------------
::

   pip install cify

Basic Example
-------------
::

   import cify as ci
   from cify.si.pso.algorithm import InertiaWeightPSO

   # Set internal seed
   set_seed(0)

   # Define objective function.
   obj_func = ci.get_objective_function('rosenbrock', ci.Optimization.Min)

   # Create swarm and algorithm.
   swarm = ci.get_swarm(10, obj_func=obj_func)
   pso = InertiaWeightPSO(obj_func, swarms=[swarm])

   # Perform 100 iterations and return the statistics of the last 5.
   pso.execute(100)
   pso.statistics.tail(5)
