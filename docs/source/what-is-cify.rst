What is CIFY?
==============

CIFY is a a comprehesive framework that simplifies the
process of writing nature-inspired computational
intelligence algorithms in Python.

Why Use CIFY?
--------------

CIFY has a low barrier of entry. The structure of the framework
is simple so there is no need for you to waste time understanding
complex hierarchical structures. Writing code should feel
natural and simple, this framework aims to achieve that.

CIFY is also adaptable. The algorithms are designed around
being customizable. Want to change a component of a
velocity update equation? Use utility functions that
allow you to add and remove components as you like or
define an entirely new function and throw it in the mix.

CIFY is repeatable. All good science requires repeatability.
When you implement your research using CIFY, you just need
to define a global seed once and all stochastic operations
will be based on this seed and execute in the same order,
every time. Anyone will be able to run your code and
get the same results.

CIFY is fast. Under the hood, algorithms run in such
a way that the minimal number of operations are performed.
There's no time spent recalculating values if they have been
calculated before.
